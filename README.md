# CSE-410-Computer-Graphics-Sessional

## Assignments
### OpenGL Programming (Offline-1)
In this offline, there were 2 tasks:<br>
<b>1) Designing an analog clock:</b> The solution was about to done by 2D OpenGL. As a bonus, we were asked to show the current time.<br>
<b>2) Designing a magic cube:</b> An octahedron is gradually converted to a sphere by clicking a keyboard key and vice-verca.

- [Magic Cube Solution](https://github.com/Mamun097/CSE-410-Computer-Graphics-Sessional/blob/main/OpenGL%20Programming/Offline_01/magic_cube.cpp) 

### OpenGL Programming (Online-1)
The online was about <b>Half Magic-Cube</b> where the lower portion of the magic cube was about to cut. By clicking a keyboard button, the upper half of the magic-cube was converted to the upper half of the sphere.
